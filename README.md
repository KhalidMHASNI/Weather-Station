# Weather-Station (Station météo)

## Abstract :
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a weather station using Arduino Uno and ESP32 microcontrollers. The station collects, analyzes, and transmits environmental data such as temperature and soil moisture. Leveraging 3D printing technology, the project integrates various sensors and components into a modular, customizable system. Future developments aim to expand sensor capabilities and integrate AI for enhanced data analysis. This repository contains the hardware schematics, software code, and 3D models necessary to replicate and extend the project.
